This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Auth Example App

I made this app as an example for students at DevMountain. It shows basic authentication, storing a user in Redux, redirecting based on whether someone is logged in, conditional rendering, and SASS.
